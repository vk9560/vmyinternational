					   In this ever changing world, we seldomthink rationally and the result being that we are always the last passengers to board the flight! We speak of modernization and think proudly to be in the 21st century never giving a second thought whether we are in tune with the changes. In fact, we are too bold to accept the fact that there is still so much to learn. We have to make strong commitments to remove our mistakes and accept reality. It is only then that our society and our country will be put into gear to surpass the present ups and downs. We beingIndians,it is our prime duty to help the ignorant ones and to rallies problems like illiteracy and communalism. The young generation is easily shadowed by westernization and ends upforgettingthe rich cultural heritage ofour country.

					   When a child fails to redeem his/her honour, he/she might either become aggressive or turn introvert and therefore, proper psychiatric treatment and counseling is needed to be given by the teachers and the parents whether at home or at the school level. The teachers should be confident of their subject & teaching and they should take up teaching as a profession with full devotion and dedication in order to impart proper education in true sense of the term. I strongly support to staff "Educatingthe MIND without MORALS creates a MANIAC in the society". Hence, a great ef fort is needed for the upliftment ofthe all round development ofa student. "Time and tide waits for none", keepingthis in view,we should try to procure the best and forget the rest.
